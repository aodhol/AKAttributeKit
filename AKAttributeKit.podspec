                        When it comes to styling texts in iOS or OSX, NSAttributedString is
                        the genie we got. But unfortunately the ginie doesn't talk much english
                        and often we are about to avoid it so.
                        Here comes AKAttributeKit to rescue. It uses HTML-ish tags in your string
                        to create expected NSAttributedString in no time. Use the same native
                        NSAttributedString without the hassle of adding attributes with verbose
                        not-so-readable code.
